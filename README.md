# Graph - Data Structure

## Terminologies
  - G(V,E) - Graph is a set of Vertices V and set of edges E
  - v - node is a indivisible point on a graph
  - e(u,v) - edge connects vertex u and vertex v together
  - d(v) - degree of the vertex is the count of edges connected to the vertex v
  
  
## Representation 
 Graph can be represented by following three approaches
  - Edge List
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Matrix
