# Graph - Data Structure

## Terminologies
  - G(V,E) - Graph is a set of Vertices V and set of edges E
  - Vertex(v) - node is a indivisible point on a graph
  - Edge(u,v) - connects vertex u and vertex v together
  - Degree d(v) of vertex v, is the count of edges connected to the vertex v
  
  
## Representation 
 Graph can be represented by following three approaches
  - Edge List
  - Adjacency List
  - Adjacency Matrix
